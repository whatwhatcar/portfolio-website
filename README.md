# portfolio-website

A minimal starter portfolio website scaffold with an example `index.html`, base styles, and small JavaScript helpers.

## What I added

- `index.html` — responsive template with header, hero, projects, about, contact, and footer
- `css/styles.css` — base styles and light/dark theme variables
- `js/main.js` — theme toggle and small helpers

## Usage

- Open `index.html` in a browser to view locally.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages or any static host.

## Next steps

- Replace placeholder text, projects, and contact info with your own content.
- Add images to `assets/` as needed.
